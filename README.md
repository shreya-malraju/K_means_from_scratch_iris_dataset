# K_means_from_scratch_iris_dataset
K-means algorithm splits unlabeled data into k clusters based on how similar they are. Based on their Euclidean distance from the centroid, each data point is assigned to the nearest cluster centroid. The centroid of each cluster is then determined by averaging its members' data points. 

DATASET

The dataset is called the “Iris Dataset”, which consists of 150 data points, divided into 3 classes, each having 50 data points. The 3 classes are- Iris_Setosa, Iris_Versicolor, Iris_Virginica.

For every data point in the dataset, there are 4 independent variables :  sepal_length, sepal_width, petal_length, petal_width. We try to find the class of each datapoint using these 4 variables, hence this dataset is Multivariate.
