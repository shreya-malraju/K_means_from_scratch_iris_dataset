# K_means_from_scratch_iris_dataset
K-means algorithm splits unlabeled data into k clusters based on how similar they are. Based on their Euclidean distance from the centroid, each data point is assigned to the nearest cluster centroid. The centroid of each cluster is then determined by averaging its members' data points.
